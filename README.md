# Codedex_Hackathon

This is to Predict how many medals each country might win in the Paris Olympics.

This project started with using the data given but I realized about three hours in I wanted to use past years so I had to restart and scrap everything. This has a Python Notebook that process the data so that a python file can use the results. The python file uses Tkinter to make a GUI that any user can use. It gives the user the ability to pick the name from a drop box. Then it will output the Medals each country is predicted to win. 

Side Notes:

I have a try one and try two folder. Try two is the final project.

I also wanted to make it into an .exe but I could not get it to become one becuase I only have Linux and everything I saw would only make a Linux version sadly. 

Lastly I have an interview I need to study for so I sadly could not work on this the full time and I didn't want to join a team to slow other people down.
